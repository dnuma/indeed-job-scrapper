# Indeed Job Scrapper

This project is a web scraping tool built using Playwright and TypeScript. It allows users to search for jobs on Indeed, specify a location, and retrieve all relevant job listings. The extracted information, including job title, details (such as salary and contract type), location, and URL, is saved into a CSV file.
